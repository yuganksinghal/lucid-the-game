Welcome to the beta version of Lucid!

To move, use the A, W, S and D keys. 

You can interact with NPCs and some objects (usually pointed out in quests) and doors with the Z key.

Guide to NPCs:
Because we haven't had enough time to implement full sprites for each character, we've compiled this handy list:
NPC inside the house downstairs - Mom
NPC inside the house upstairs - Strange Boy
NPC outside your house - Old Man With Dog
NPC outside the house to the left - Sales Clerk Girl
NPC near the mansion/mushroom patch - Mysterious Stranger

The game shuts off when you reach the chapel. The following section is the finale + plot twist,
 and will be added before the expo!


Things to fix:

Sound broke in attempts to make it better :(

Add more content and the ending of the game.

Fix an NPC-spritesheet-loading glitch

Add a different animated sprite for each NPC.

Constrain NPC movement to small areas (it's currently free-roam or stand-still, 
so we set it to the latter for the beta).
