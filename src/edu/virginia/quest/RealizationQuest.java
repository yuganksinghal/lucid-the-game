	//you haven't been losing lucidity, you've been GAINING IT!
		//kinda at least. mostly you have been coming to terms
		//with the fact that the town is gone
	//once you walk into the town square you realize...
		//A)the town still exists but it's filled with different people now?
		//B)the town is condemned now?
